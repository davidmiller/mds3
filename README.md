This is mds3 - an [OPAL](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal) project.

This project was an exploratory look at the complexities of creating an Opal project that used traditional form submission rather than single page apps and javascript for places where browsers live firmly in the past.

To get started, run the following commands:

```
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
```
